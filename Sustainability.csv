So why deal with the hassles and high price of car ownership for a car you only need a couple of days a week? Whenever you need a car, we deliver a hybrid RAV4 SUV or Prius.

Then simply return anywhere in the city - we’ll pick it up, refuel and clean it for you for next time. Our transparent subscriptions are for people driving around 1-3 days/week and include everything you need like full coverage insurance, maintenance, and roadside assistance.Sharing cars means fewer cars made, owned, and parked. Our hybrid fleet uses half the gas (and produces half the CO2). Our cars have the latest semi-autonomous technologies like adaptive cruise control, pre-collision avoidance, and blind spot monitor detection to keep you safe - you practically don’t even need to drive or park them!

Quidnet operates at the nexus of energy and water to provide cost-effective, grid-scale electricity storage.
This enables predictable delivery of power from intermittent sources and large-scale deployment of renewable energy.

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
Decarbonization of the electricity grid is an essential component to solving climate change and recognizing this, a tremendous effort is underway to bring renewable generation onto the grid, such as wind and solar.

However, grid decarbonization today is at an impasse. The intermittency of renewable generators are causing ever larger power swings on the grid, leading to blackouts and forced curtailments. Without a cost-effective electricity storage solution to buffer those swings and ""shift"" renewable power to when the grids needs it, renewables will be nothing but a niche source of clean power.

Water is a vital energy resource and can be utilized to efficiently store electricity at extremely large capacities.  Pumped hydro is by far the largest and most cost-effective form of energy storage today (over 100 GW worldwide). However, due to dependency on terrain, pumped hydro could not be widely implemented, until Quidnet.","Enabling grid stability with renewable energy through cost-effective, large-scale electricity storage.","['Energy', 'Climate Adaptation']",['6-10']

PowerFlex has deployed some of the largest single-site EV charging deployments in the world thanks to their Adaptive Charging Network (ACN) technology. This system enables site hosts to maximize delivery of electricity to EVs while reducing or eliminating the need for costly utility upgrades by managing charging depending on driver’s demand, building load, onsite generation, and other variables.

In September of 2019 EDF Renewables North America acquired PowerFlex Systems. Incorporating the PowerFlex technology alongside the Companies existing solar, storage, and energy management offering, they can provide building owners and facility managers with a single energy ecosystem where all assets work in concert to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable carbon-free power when and where it is needed.","Revolutionizing EV charging with adaptive, large-scale, carbon-free, affordable energy solutions.","['Energy', 'Transportation', 'Buildings']",['6-10']

membrion.com/,,Membrion,"Seattle, WA, USA","Filtering Ions to Save the Planet
Membrion™  is at the forefront of some of the world’s most challenging problems: clean water, global electrification and human health. The emerging technologies designed to revolutionize these fields all depend on filtering charged molecules, called ions. The need for low cost/high performance ion filters has never been stronger or more urgent.



One only has to look at California to see the potential impact of ion filters on drinking and agricultural water supplies. With annual snowpack deletion and persistent drought fueled by climate change, California (and many other parts of the world) faces fresh water crisis. One of the most viable solutions to this challenge is to purify brackish water through electrodialysis. While the state has 38 times more brackish water than fresh water supplies, and while electrodialysis is less costly than older technologies like reverse osmosis, existing expensive and low performance ion filters have prevented electrodialysis from being widely adopted. Membrion’s low cost/high performance membranes will enable dramatically lower cost solutions to produce potable water for agriculture and urban usage, all while using less energy and creating less waste than existing solutions today.



Ion filters are also at the heart of the burgeoning urban mobility market which is moving towards low cost, electric-powered solutions that are available on-demand. Each of these new solutions, from the scooter to the bike to the car, rely on Li-ion or other batteries today, or fuel cells tomorrow. In both cases, the word will need efficient and effective ion filters to expand beyond the capacity of today’s solutions.



This need is not isolated to transportation. California is the 5th largest economy in the world and is moving to 100% renewable energy by 2045, and some of the world’s largest and most admired brands, including Google, Ikea, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Nike, GM and Lego among many others, have also committed to 100% renewable energy. Energy storage is key to that success and new low cost/high performance ion filters are the limiting factor for today’s generation of flow batteries, the most promising grid scale-storage solution.

It’s hard to believe that such small molecules have such a big impact on the world’s future, but they do. Our efforts to bring a unique ion filter to market can materially accelerate a variety of new technologies to improve the lives of humans today and protect the future health of our planet.","""Pioneering affordable, high-performance ion filters to tackle water scarcity and boost renewable energy storage.""","['Energy', 'Transportation']",['6-10']

masienda.com/,,Masienda,"Los Angeles, CA, USA","In 2014, we set out on an earnest search for a corn tortilla with exceptional flavor and integrity. Our quest took us to Oaxaca, Mexico, where we met farmers whose families have been cultivating traditional maize for centuries. It was there that we experienced our first perfect, true tortilla.

With each stack of tortillas that we passed and savored, the connection became increasingly clear: genetic diversity, regenerative farming and time-honored technique consistently yielded a dynamic, delicious range of flavors, textures and culinary applications from which to choose.

We soon started collaborating with these farming communities, sharing their heirloom corn varieties and traditions with top restaurants around the world. Masienda was born.

Today, Masienda proudly partners with hundreds of traditional farmers to grow, source and offer the highest quality single-origin ingredients. We continue to collaborate with chefs to develop in-house, specialty masa programs for their restaurants, while also working to create thoughtful resources, tools and value-added products to lead a new standard for masa quality, preparation and consumption.

We believe that the best-tasting food is achieved through a relentless support of agricultural biodiversity, sustainability and independent farmers. With this philosophy in mind, our mission is to build a new kind of masa value chain, from scratch.","Sustainably sourced heirloom corn, boosting agricultural biodiversity and supporting traditional farmers.","['Food, Agriculture, & Land Use']",['6-10']
www.mallinda.com,,Mallinda,"Aurora, CO, USA","MALLINDA MAKES REVERSIBLE THERMOSET PREPREG LAMINATES FOR HIGH THROUGHPUT COMPOSITE PART PRODUCTION
Mallinda's patented resin system eliminates the slow infusion and long curing cycles of today's resins; enabling compression-molding of products in just seconds for high-throughput, high-volume production of structural composites. In addition, our prepreg is pre-cured, shelf-stable, and requires no refrigeration for transport and storage.

Mallinda's prepreg resin is a disruptive platform technology that allows rapid (< 1 minute) compression molding of fully cured thermoset composite parts. It is designed for carbon fiber composite production using rapid compression molding techniques analogous to sheet metal stamping. In addition, Mallinda’s resin can be depolymerized in solution for a cradle-to-cradle, energy-neutral system for the recovery of resin and woven/full-length fiber.

A Range of Processing Temperatures & Range of Mechanical Properties

Mallinda’s resin can be formulated to have a low molding temperature range. Our resin can be molded at temperatures as low as ~20 ̊C and as high as ~150 ̊C, depending on formulation. In some applications, this feature has the benefit of allowing end-users to custom mold our resin or composites derived therefrom, to suit the end user’s needs without the use of expensive and massive industrial equipment.

In addition, Mallinda's material can be formulated to have a range of mechanical properties - from elastomeric to crystalline.

Mallinda is currently developing its material to meet the specs of the automotive market.

Short Cycle Times & Repairability

Due to the malleable nature of our resin, fully cured composite sheets can be perfectly welded together in less than 1 minute.  This means that Mallinda’s composites can be substituted for prepreg sheet, but can be stored at room temperature (or higher) indefinitely, and do not require a curing step.  Only heat and pressure are required to mold the cured sheets into shape, and similarly, heat and pressure treatment can heal or repair damage (such as impact damage) in the material.

Reprocessable

Mallinda’s resin may be recycled many times over. The plastic may be ground into a powder and reformed into new shapes with heat and pressure. This both increases the input lifetime vis-a-vis recycling and reduces the energy required during repurposing.

In addition, Mallinda's ability to implement solid state thermoforming could revolutionize production of powder-based composite materials.

Environmentally Friendly Synthesis

No heavy metal catalysts or organic solvents are used in making our resin. And the only byproduct in the chemical production is water.

What does this mean?

It means that we have created one of the most user-friendly plastic materials to date.","Revolutionizing high-throughput composites with recyclable, low-energy resins for a sustainable future.","['Materials & Manufacturing', 'Research & Education', 'Climate Adaptation']",['6-10']

A Solar Future
Although GoSun is still a small entrepreneurial business, we believe we should all do what we can, when we can. Since our inception, we've worked with dozens of nonprofit organizations to provide discounted solar cookers and other solar products to those that need them most.

GoSun has provided funding to support the efforts of The Houston Food Bank, Global Giving, and Operation BBQ Relief. In 2018, we made donations to The American Red Cross and World Central Kitchen to assist in Hurricane Florence relief efforts and to the California Community Wildfire Relief Fund to aid in the the camp fire relief efforts.

GoSun Empowerment
Around one billion people do not have access to electricity and over three billion people still cook on dangerous, polluting stoves that run on dirty fuels: wood, charcoal and petrochemical fires.

https://www.forestsforever.org/,,Forests Forever,"Berkeley, CA, USA","Forests Forever was founded in 1989 during the historic campaign to save the Headwaters ancient redwood forest in Humboldt County, California. Although we didn’t get all the forest saved, 7500 acres including several large virgin groves were eventually acquired and can be visited today. Our efforts helped galvanize the broad-based public awareness and outcry that led to this and many other forest victories across the state.


For almost 30 years we have been rallying Californians in defense of the state’s 17 million acres of woodland ecosystems and watersheds. We accomplish this through year-round education, grassroots organizing, litigation, work in elections, and executive-branch and legislative advocacy.

In 2016 several of Forests Forever's proudest accomplishments centered on the protection of California's fast-disappearing oak woodlands.

For the roughly seven million acres of oak woodlands in the state, the vast majority are on private land, enjoy scanty or no protection, and are rapidly being bulldozed to make way for housing developments, vineyards, highways and shopping malls.

In Mendocino County we played a key role in qualifying, then promoting, a voter initiative that effectively would ban the large-scale tree-poisoning method known as “hack and squirt.” On June 7 it passed on a solid 62 percent majority!

We also helped to qualify a ballot measure in Napa County—the Water, Forest, and Oak Woodland Protection Initiative. It would establish no-cut stream buffers while limiting the destruction of oak woodlands.

We were among the founding members of a new coalition in 2016, the California Oaks Coalition.

And in the City of Richmond, we helped to qualify and then to win a citizens initiative that protected some 430 acres of oak forest and savanna threatened with development adjacent to Wildcat Canyon Regional Park.


In 2014 and 2015 Forests Forever spent a great deal of effort playing a leading role in what has become a momentous struggle to fully realize what is our latest—and could be our last—great opportunity to thoroughly overhaul California’s broken system that regulates logging practices.

With letters and calls from our many supporters, coupled with the relentless pressure of our policy advocate, state officials began to listen and after years of advocacy work, legislation, and grassroots organizing California's first forestry-reform pilot project got underway in December 2016. “Cumulative watershed effects” assessment has been a fundamental requirement of the state’s forestry laws, but honored only in the breach for some 40 years. Now with the pilot project finally begun there's much reason to look for a positive outcome.

For one thing, Forests Forever's forest policy advocate Richard Gienger has been selected as one of the 21-person Pilot Project Working Group that will oversee the project it should wrap up in about two years.

Farming is risky. For farmers who are building the quality of their soil every year, insecure land tenure critically inhibits multi-year business planning. Many talented farmers with profitable operations do not qualify for a conventional loan and/or do not have enough capital saved to make a large down payment. The primary alternative is leased land, which is often short-term, insecure and requires permission from landowners to erect basic farm infrastructure.

It has very high mitigation potential compared to other available methods, and also has relatively low cost.

OIF works by improving the efficiency of natural phytoplankton production in the open ocean, adding to the very large natural amount of carbon sequestration that takes place in the world's oceans every year. Publicly funded research scientists have investigated aspects of the science behind the technique in twelve small-scale experimental trials since 1993, which have shown that the addition of iron can stimulate large blooms of phytoplankton.

The term was first popularized by our Founder, Henry Gordon-Smith, in Fall 2011 when Henry was researching how cities could use agriculture to address environmental, social and economic challenges, and to develop resilient food systems in the face of climate change. By definition, Agritecture is about applying architectural thinking when designing agriculture for the built environment.

In practice, architects and urban farmers incorporate agriculture into the surrounding city environment in very different ways. Architects frequently design impossible vertical farming and urban agriculture concepts that ignore the realities of successful farming operations. In contrast, agriculturalists and entrepreneurs often miss important design, aesthetic, and social integration opportunities when they develop urban farms. Agritecture is about integrating the disciplines of agriculture and architecture so that urban farms can be both practical and well-designed all at once.

 Today, Agritecture’s blog covers a wide range of global and local urban agriculture news, including topics such as: greenhouse production, vertical farming, aquaponics, hydroponics, regenerative agriculture, ag-tech, and food systems more broadly. Agritecture’s consulting services are designed to help entrepreneurs, developers, and cities plan and launch successful agritecture, urban agriculture, vertical farming, and local food system projects.

www.echromic.com,,Echromic,"Boulder, CO, USA","e-Chromic Technologies is developing an innovative reflective electrochromic thin film that enables users to control light and solar heat transmission through windows.
Energy Efficient
Windows are the single greatest source of energy waste within most commercial and residential buildings. Our diffusely reflective electrochromic thin film will reduce air conditioner usage and related CO² emissions by ~35%. Unlike most other smart window technologies, our electrochromic window film is completely user controllable. On sunny warm weather days, it can be switched to reflective mode to significantly reduce solar heating through windows and dramatically reduce air conditioner usage.

During cold weather days, it can be switched to transparent mode, allowing solar heating to assist with interior warming, therefore reducing heating system usage. DOE energy models indicate that our reflective technology will deliver 43% greater energy savings than state of the art absorptive technologies at less than half the cost.

Retrofit
Dynamic window technologies on the market today turn dark when activated, causing them to absorb sunlight and convert it to heat. In order to isolate this “heating problem” (which can reach 60°C), providers must build their dynamic window surfaces into the interior of expensive new window units.

Our proprietary patented electrochromic thin film turns diffusely reflective when activated. This uniquely reflective technology does not suffer from the “heating problem” of the absorptive technologies. Therefore, our thin film can be used to retrofit installed windows. It can be applied from inside an office or home to existing windows, transforming them into highly energy efficient smart windows, cost effectively and with a minimum of occupant dislocation. Make your windows part of the ""internet of things.""

Market Size
The market for competing absorptive dynamic window technologies that requires purchase and installation of new windows is severely limited to new construction or major building rehab projects. The market opportunity for retrofit of existing installed windows is vastly larger. DOE estimates that there are 19.5 billion ft² of installed windows in the US alone. An estimated 536 million ft² are installed in commercial buildings in the US. Most of these buildings were constructed prior to implementation of ASHRAE standards in 1990. It is estimated that approximately 90% of installed windows in commercial buildings are not energy efficient. This results in an addressable market for

An estimated 536 million ft² are installed in commercial buildings in the US. Most of these buildings were constructed prior to implementation of ASHRAE standards in 1990. It is estimated that approximately 90% of installed windows in commercial buildings are not energy efficient. This results in an addressable market for retrofit that is measured in billions of dollars for the US alone. International market opportunities are even more attractive due to significantly higher costs for electricity.

Technology
Our proprietary reflective electrochromic technology was invented at the US Dept. of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden CO. We have an exclusive license with NREL to develop and commercialize this patented technology. Our electrochromic film will be wirelessly powered by the sun. It can be wirelessly controlled through an interface with a building management system, iOS or Android device.

Your windows join the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Buildings and Smart Cities. Our reflective film can also be deposited onto flat glass and be built into new windows.

eChemion develops advanced materials for energy storage and power generation markets. Our focus is to design and manufacture materials that improve performance while simultaneously improving our customers’ gross margins. With an electrical infrastructure capable of generating and distributing renewable energy, eChemion believes the cost of renewable energy should converge on being “free,” with the only recurrent cost arising in maintenance fees. However, due to the misalignment between when energy demand is placed on the grid and when renewable energy generation can be provided to the grid, renewable energy must have a way of being stored until it is needed.

We envision the emergence of an international system of regional textile communities that enliven connection and ownership of ‘soil-to-soil’ textile processes. These diverse textile cultures are designed to build soil carbon stocks on the working landscapes on which they depend, while directly enhancing the strength of regional economies.

seatrec.com/,,SeaTrec,"Seattle, WA, USA","Seatrec harvests energy from temperature differences in the environment to power underwater research, industry, and defense.

OCEAN:
Seatrec’s initial focus is a thermal engine to power underwater platforms, vehicles, and sensors in support of ocean research and national defense. Unmanned underwater platforms and vehicles accelerate ocean exploration and facilitate routine monitoring and surveillance – but require a source of electrical power for propulsion, navigation, data collection, and communications. Typically, this power is supplied by toxic and potentially hazardous lithium batteries of which several tons per year are discarded at sea. Seatrec has developed and patented a compact, modular thermal engine that extracts energy from the ocean’s vertical temperature gradient and converts it to electricity.

Seatrec’s first product, the SL1 Thermal Engine, will support the family of 4000+ expendable, vertically-profiling robotic probes currently deployed in the global ocean as part of an international observing network. The SL1 can dramatically extend the operating lifetime of a profiling float — or enhance its utility through increased profiling rates and support of energy-intensive sensors for biogeochemical and acoustical studies. Variants of this system are currently being developed for integration with underwater gliders, moored profilers, and other high-endurance undersea platforms.

ICE:
Persistent observing systems are required to probe the coupled dynamics of atmosphere, ocean, and ice and associated biogeochemical and ecosystem processes in the pristine polar maritime environment. As in the ocean, lithium-chemistry batteries limit endurance and are associated with high operational costs, safety hazards and negative environmental impacts. In many circumstances neither wind nor solar are viable options for high-latitude applications due to contamination by snow and ice and by the inevitable darkness of polar winter.

Seatrec is developing a novel environmental energy harvesting system that extracts thermal energy from the high-latitude air-sea temperature differential and converts it to clean, useful electricity (patent pending). This effort will result in a clean energy source that could fundamentally alter the logistics and economics of polar observing system operations. The air-sea thermal engine will support oceanographic and meteorological monitoring stations and buoys, navigational beacons, communication nodes, ice-based sensor packages, and satellite-to-acoustic data relays. The system will be compact, low-maintenance and capable of long-term deployment on a fixed platform, buoy, or ice floe – or on a mobile platform such as a drifting buoy or autonomous surface vehicle.

LAND:
Temperature differences on land occur in many forms, both temporal and spatial. Where permanent solar arrays or wind turbines are not appropriate, the diurnal (day-night) temperature differential at a specific location can be utilized to generate power for applications ranging from backcountry recreation to remote communications facilities to covert surveillance and border security. Terrestrial applications exploiting vertical temperature differences between the air, earth, and groundwater are also being explored to support residential, industrial, and defense energy requirements in remote, off-grid locations.",Harvests energy from temperature differences to eliminate hazardous batteries and power clean underwater research.,"['Coastal & Ocean Sinks', 'Energy']",['6-10']
www.sealtheseasons.com,,Seal the Seasons,"Chapel Hill, NC, USA","Who we are:
Since 2000, more than 21 percent of small family farms have been forced to close. These farmers struggled to find a market for their fruit and year after year they were forced to leave some of their crop in the field. Eventually, it became too much and they had to close their doors.

Patrick Mateer met many struggling farmers while working at his local farmers market during his college years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Patrick also noticed an uptick in the demand for local food by consumers, who could only access it a couple weeks out of the year when a crop was in season.
​
Patrick founded Seal the Seasons in 2014 to connect the dots - making local frozen produce available year-round, while also helping provide small family farms with a reliable income stream year after year.

We work with family farmers on a state-by-state basis to freeze their produce in season and sell it in local grocery stores 365 days a year. We are on a mission to create a more localized food system and make local available in every aisle of the grocery store year-round.

Local matters:
Eating well means buying from local farmers and enjoying the best tasting produce all year long. Ideally, produce would be served on your table less than five days after being harvested.
​
The reality? Because of the way our current food system works, produce can often take more than a month on their journey from farm-to-table. These crops are chosen for hardiness and durability, which often means they are less nutritious and less tasty than those that are locally-grown.

​

Freezing locally-grown produce efficiently preserves the taste and nutrition of these perishable products, making it possible for local produce to be consistently available throughout the year. Our close relationships with local farmers allows us to source only the best produce, without worry about the need to survive lengthy transport.

www.rnagri.com/,,RNAgri,"St. Louis, MO, USA","RNAgri is a startup making huge progress in RNA production and RNAi products. RNAi, which is an abbreviation for RNA interference, is a technology that relies on gene regulation without the heritable effects on DNA. Because RNAi works downstream from DNA, it is not genetic modification and therefore is non-GMO. RNAgri has developed technology that will allow the cost-efficient production of RNA for topical RNAi uses in broad acre agriculture and in urban-structural pest control. Other high use rate applications for RNA such as for RNAi in aquaculture or animal husbandry could also benefit.

RNAi has potential to provide non-GMO traits in the field without genetic modification. RNAi is extremely specific and can provide very selective insect control without potential for off target effects; this opens up the potential for beneficial insects and improvements in biodiversity. This technology can reverse herbicide resistance in weeds and pesticide resistance in insects.

The agricultural traits and agricultural and urban and structural pest control businesses provide enormous value to society and generate billions of dollars in revenue for major agricultural companies. RNAi based products will provide complements and replacements for many current technologies and thus will create enormous value for agricultural companies and for society at large.

RNAgri has dependable third party validation of its Intellectual Property as well as unfettered freedom to operate.

Yet, even as that industry has proven destructive to our health, our feathered friends and our planet, it has enjoyed uninterrupted growth for decades.We dared to ask.What if we could make chicken better?What if we could give people everything they love about chicken—the flavor, the texture, the experience—without the chicken?

But the UN estimates that we have only 11 years left to change our consumption patterns before we do irreversible damage to the environment, so we’re of the opinion that now is the time for big bets.We’re starting in the world of recycling, which has a huge opportunity for impact. Americans send 1.4 million tons of waste to recycling facilities every week (that’s about 4 Empire State Buildings, or 1.5 Golden Gate Bridges).

Otherwise they go out of business and our recycling goes straight to the landfill. Even so, recycling facilities today use processes that are highly manual, expensive, and error prone. We plan to revolutionize the way these facilities use technology, to make them more streamlined, accurate, and profitable - which means more recyclables avoid the landfill, and more of our natural resources are protected.Our growing team draws from the brightest and most passionate professionals across robotics, manufacturing, software, AI, and market strategy.

Our design will allow intermittent renewable electricity sources, such as solar and wind, to meet continual demand.FELLOWChristopher GravesChristopher GravesChris Graves has focused on sustainable energy and materials since 2004. After receiving his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 2010 on the topic of storing renewable electricity by converting CO2 and H2O into hydrocarbon fuels with high temperature electrolysis cells, he continued electrochemistry research at the Technical University of Denmark, most recently as a senior scientist. Graves has led projects on novel electrochemical energy storage technologies, from new materials to modeling and characterization of cells to design and techno-economic analysis of systems. He has collaborated with NASA and was a visiting scholar at Stanford University on related electrochemical materials and devices.In 2012 he invented a new type of rechargeable flow battery. After extensive lab-scale proof-of-concept research, he founded Noon Energy in 2018 to further develop and commercialize this breakthrough technology.TECHNOLOGYCritical NeedSolar and wind power are growing rapidly and dominating new electricity generation globally. New low-cost energy storage technologies are urgently needed to balance these intermittent renewables. Available storage systems are inadequate: conventional batteries and electrolytic hydrogen are too expensive and pumped hydro and compressed air are geographically constrained.Unlike lithium-ion batteries, flow batteries and reversible electrolyzers decouple energy capacity and power capacity, which means the cost of storage decreases with increasing storage duration. However, these flow systems suffer from expensive storage media (vanadium) or low roundtrip energy efficiency (power-to-gas and back), and complex balance-of-system for flow management. All of these factors have kept long-duration storage for grid-scale renewable energy out of reach.Technology VisionNoon Energy's battery can match the energy efficiency of lithium-ion technology while using ultra-low-cost storage, enabling system-level costs of less than $50 per kWh capacity for hours or days of storage time.Whereas existing batteries store energy in relatively expensive metals like vanadium, cobalt, and lithium, our battery stores energy in ultra-low-cost elements like hydrogen, carbon and oxygenstorage media that cost well below $1 per kWh capacity.The clear target is long-duration storage coupled to intermittent solar and wind power to provide dispatchable electricity, a market which is growing quickly due to increasing deployment and falling costs of these clean energy sources.Potential for ImpactLong-duration, economical energy storage will make a major contribution to revolutionizing the energy sector and integrating rapidly growing solar and wind renewable electricity supplies, beginning with stationary storage. In addition, the high energy density of the Noon Energy battery opens the door to transportation applications such as electric vehicles and aircraft. Low-cost storage would reduce energy imports, pollution, and emissions.Noon is Looking for...Technical collaboratorsFundersJoint development partnersTeam members - engineers, interns","""Economical long-duration storage to integrate and maximize solar and wind energy.""","['Energy', 'Transportation', 'Carbon Removal Tech']",['6-10']

ConnectMyEV's charging system is based on its proprietary conductive hands free charging technology which is 100% efficient and is scalable to high power levels required for DC fast charging. Being conductive, it's capable of orchestrating large power swings to optimally take advantage of real-time energy pricing. This can significantly lower the cost of charging your EV and in some cases even pay you back to charge.ConnectMyEV, technology can be retrofitted onto an EV or can be deployed as an add-on accessory at the time of EV purchase. The charging system comprises of (i) a ground side unit, (ii) a vehicle side unit, (iii) a dongle that plugs into OBD-II port, (iv) a wall unit and (v) an app for your smart phone. The ground side unit has a low profile and it can be placed on the surface of garage floor or where you would normally park your EV - such as a driveway. The vehicle side unit - which is the size of a smartphone, receives the energy from the deployed arm of ground side unit. The energy received is routed to the SAE-J-1772 charge port that exists on all EVs.Once connected, the ConnectMyEV system will communicate to utility servers to acquire real-time pricing information. ConnectMyEV's optimizing computer then takes into account instantaneous and predicted energy prices, any ""transactional energy"" coupons you may have purchased and the constraints as to when the vehicle readiness is required. With this information, it will chart a course - and continually correct it, to charge your EV so that it's ready when you want it, while minimizing the overall cost to charge.

We exist to replace the old extractive systems, and revolutionize them with new forms of sustainable production that are good for business and the planet.Carbon transformation involves breaking down carbon into its fundamental elements and building them back up into healthy nutrients and a range of bio-based products that are friendlier to our planet.In recognizing that the existing supply chain model is unfit for the needs of our planet and growing population, we have created a series of commercial solutions that set a new bar in the circular economy by transforming carbon instead of extracting further resources from our planet.With 50+ patents granted or pending on our NASA-inspired technology, we are addressing key supply chain challenges from price volatility, land and water usage, to overall efficiency all while creating new ways of making products that leverage existing resources and are less extractive and detrimental to our planet.The inspiration behind Kiverdi began in the 1960's with NASA on a quest for deep space travel.The scientists, challenged with how to produce food for a year-long mission with limited space and resources, soon discovered a special class of microbes. These natural single-cell organisms, specifically, called hydrogenotrophs, act like plants in converting carbon dioxide into food.The concept was simple. Astronauts would exhale CO2, which would be captured by the microbes, then converted, with other inputs such as power and water, into food, which would feed the astronauts. The astronauts would exhale CO2, further enabling the hydrogenotrophs to continue producing an endless cycle of nutrients.Leveraging NASA's concepts, we are applying the same thinking to our planet. Not only are we capturing our over abundance of CO2, but we are using it as the key input in creating nutrients and bio-based products.With 36 billion tons of CO2 emitted around the globe each year, we know our work is just beginning. We have 46+ patents granted or pending of carbon transformation technology that can be applied to a range of industries.

https://www.oleospos.com,Gabriella Dweck,Oleo Sustainable Palm Oil Solutions,"Bay Area, CA, USA","Seed oils, such as palm and soy, are top drivers of deforestation and major greenhouse gas emitters, yet are deeply embedded across corporate supply chains from consumer goods to biofuels. It's estimated that 20-30 percent of all agricultural land is dedicated to growing oilseed crops, emitting 5-25X more greenhouse gasses than other crops. Despite the deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions associated with vegetable oil production, global demand is steadily rising. Developing sustainable oil production methods that don’t depend on arable land is necessary to meet rising seed oil demand without depleting finite natural resources.Oleo Sustainable Palm Oil Solutions is developing a process for transforming wasted biomass into sustainable oil inputs for consumer goods and biofuel supply chains. Oleo's technology leverages a two-step process in which we extract fermentable sugars from recalcitrant biomass using microwave technology and then use those fermentable sugars as a substrate for fermenting yeast in the second step of our process to produce lipids with the same fatty acid profile as palm oil. Oleo's technology can help eliminate the need for land conversion while meeting rising global demand for vegetable oils.Oleo’s process produces a low-carbon oil that has the potential to replace carbon-intensive oils across the consumer goods and biofuels industries, abating carbon emissions and eliminating the need for deforestation. Not only can Oleo’s product prevent tropical deforestation by displacing palm oil from corporate supply chains, but it can also serve as a feedstock for producing biofuels for use in maritime shipping and aviation to help decarbonize difficult-to-electrify transportation industry segments.",We transform biomass waste into sustainable palm oil with the mission of decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and halting palm oil driven deforestation.,"['Energy', 'Materials & Manufacturing', 'Food, Agriculture, & Land Use']",['1-5']

The majority of the carbon removed precipitates in the roadbed as carbonate minerals, making MRV straightforward.  We are working to optimize carbon capture through changes in the steel slag mixtures, grain size, roadbed thickness, and moisture conditions.  In the future, we will also test new use cases for steel slags to further optimize their use as a CDR feedstock.",Permanent carbon removal | Better gravel roads,['Carbon Removal Tech'],['6-10']

http://www.greenblu.co,GreenBlu,GreenBlu,"Hamilton Township, NJ, USA","GreenBlu has developed a suite of technologies to recover valuable resources from seawater and other brines including desalination waste. Decarbonized magnesium metal can be produced using only renewable electricity and seawater/brine. No waste brine is generated because magnesium chloride is physically extracted from the seawater, reducing salinity while adding zero chemicals. The ocean contains nearly 2 billion megatons of Mg metal, enough for 2 billion years at current consumption. Decades faster than terrestrial mining, we will be first to market with U.S. produced magnesium at globally competitive prices. Magnesium production innovation has stagnated for fifty years. GreenBlu has innovated several patented technologies to create a proprietary method of extracting an unlimited amount of sustainable magnesium for the global Energy Transition. Magnesium is the lightest structural metal weighing 75% less than steel and 33% less than aluminum. We are creating a metal with a 95-fold leverage on decarbonization. Every ton of decarbonized production avoids 28 tons of carbon emissions compared to current methods. Every ton substituted for steel in a car or truck avoids another 67 tons in just one vehicle lifetime. Magnesium is crucial in the production of aluminum alloys, titanium, and steel. Present in nearly all military vehicles, it is vital for national security. Magnesium hydride is a leading candidate for hydrogen storage and transportation. Headquartered near Princeton, New Jersey, GreenBlu was founded in 2016 by three physicists from the Princeton Plasma Physics National Lab. Recognizing brine mining as a revolutionary technique required for the energy transition, GreenBlu was founded to extract valuable dissolved minerals out of previously unviable sources.

In an evolving landscape marked by stringent regulations and a growing need for sustainable practices, our platform plays a critical role in addressing the unique challenges faced by smaller real estate owners.Some industry backgroundEconomic and environmental factors should compel building owners to proactively seek cost reduction through energy efficiency improvements, yet they haven’t, at least not at scale.  Until recently there has been no forcing function to catalyze innovation or explosive growth in the energy consulting industry. That is now changing as major jurisdictions have begun adopting legislation requiring energy audits for residential and commercial buildings to meet carbon emissions reduction goals.New York City is the first to require this type of audit on a yearly basis for many buildings within its jurisdiction. This legislation is significant as it increases not only the population of buildings that require this type of audit (25,000 sq-ft or larger, reduced from the prior 50,000 sq-ft threshold), but also the frequency of audits (yearly, rather than once every 10 years). Whereas energy audits were previously an occasional inconvenience for building owners, they will now be a regular feature of building ownership,maintenance, and compliance.The result of these changes will be a huge increase in the demand for energy audits from the energy consulting industry. Notably, because the industry standard pay structure is a per-square-foot model, firms have tended to favor clients with larger buildings and consequently larger profit potential.  However, when yearly audits become required by law, there will be a massive influx of small and medium size buildings that firms will need to service without unduly draining their resources or negatively affecting their bottom line.","Streamlines carbon management for small buildings, ensuring compliance and reducing emissions.","['Energy', 'Buildings', 'Climate Adaptation']",['1-5']

www.electrifiedthermal.com,Katherine Ullman,Electrified Thermal Solutions,"Medford, MA, USA","Our innovation is the electrically-conductive firebrick, the heart of the Joule Hive thermal battery (JHTB). This innovation enables two characteristics with profound implications for decarbonizing industry globally. The first is that the electrically conductive firebrick is the first heating element that can convert electricity to temperatures up to 1,800°C that can scale to electrify the highest temperature, hardest to abate sectors including steel, cement, glass, chemicals.  The second is that these high temperatures correlate to unprecedented energy density which enables the cost-effective storage of that thermal energy with >95% efficiency and therefore cheap off-peak electricity can be used to bring the cost of decarbonizing below or close to parity with existing fossil fuel sources.The Joule Hive thermal battery is a stack of electrically conductive firebricks in an insulated steel container and an electrical balance of plant. The JHTB charges by running electricity directly through the bricks to joule-heat them up to 1800°C, the thermal energy is stored at that temperature, and then the system is discharged by running air or another gas through the brick channels to provide heat to any furnace, boiler, turbine, or kiln.","Electrifying energy-intensive industries via high-temperature thermal batteries for efficient, cost-effective decarbonization.","['Energy', 'Materials & Manufacturing']",['6-10']

Many critical tools require steel, concrete, and other products that are carbon-intensive to produce conventionally. To avert the worst impacts of climate change, we need to radically change the CO2emissions profiles of these materials and remove remaining CO2emissions from the atmosphere that are infeasible or unethical to avoid.We're solving these problems by extracting magnesium and other metals from abundant rocks and storing CO2in the form of magnesium carbonate or bicarbonate. Scarce metals in the rocks are separated and sold for use in batteries, steel, and other products. Process reagents are recycled using electrochemical reactors. Our solution stands out in its novel adaptation of techniques employed in metallurgical and water treatment fields, which indicates potential for rapid scaleup. Further, our success is less subject to bureaucratic unknowns, since we do not need CO2pipelines and wells that have complex permitting. In addition, our co-products offset costs of CO2storage.",Scalable mineral processing for durable carbon storage and sustainable metal production.,['Carbon Removal Tech'],['1-5']

https://www.circleseafoods.com/,Eren Shultz,Circle Seafoods,"Aberdeen, WA, USA","Wild Alaskan salmon might be the last great underleveraged natural resource. It has unparalleled quality and sustainability. But, after it’s caught, it’s largely wasted by an antiquated supply chain that leaves $1B+ of value on the table each year.The status quo supply chain has three key problems. First, low quality, because 3-7 days pass before fish are frozen. During this waiting period, fish rot in lukewarm water on under-refrigerated boats. The second problem is low yield - up to 40% of the salmon are thrown out due to time and quality constraints. And the third issue is that the status quo supply chain is unnecessarily  complex, which consumes most of the potential margin.Circle Seafoods transforms the broken supply chain for wild Alaskan salmon, using innovative barges to deep freeze, store and transport fish. This approach radically improves the economics, unlocking north of $100M of EBITDA by year 3 of operations, while cutting the carbon footprint in half, eliminating waste and generating substantial income for thousands of small businesses (Alaskan fishers) across economically distressed communities. Circle’s approach solves the legacy quality, yield and cost problems. Circle builds large freezing and storage barges that are located where fish are caught. Based on a successful prototype by Pat Glaab, Circle’s CEO, Circle’s barges blast freeze the whole salmon within hours of when it’s caught. This locks in sushi-grade quality at scale. Once the fishing season is complete, the fish are unloaded for processing on demand, using the entire fish in the optimal way.Ultimately, we believe Circle can increase the size of the Alaskan salmon market, capture most of a $1.5B gross profit pool there, and apply the same technique to other fisheries around the world expanding Circle's TAM to >$100bn annually and ushering in a drastically more carbon efficient cold chain for wild and farmed fish.",Transforming Alaskan salmon supply chain to halve carbon footprint and eliminate waste.,"['Food, Agriculture, & Land Use', 'Coastal & Ocean Sinks', 'Climate Adaptation']",['6-10']

According to the IPCC, the world's leading scientific voice on climate change, humanity must directly remove more than 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphereannuallyby 2050, and in perpetuity, to meet global net zero ambitions.For context, that is an industry 1,000,000x larger than today's current direct air capture industry.

Therefore, retrofitting 80 million home HVAC systems with modern heat pumps is the single biggest residential decarbonization opportunity we have. It is critical we get this once-in-a-generation shift infrastructure and building electrification transition right.Getting it right begins with the right design. Replacing a conventional HVAC system with a heat pump is not a simple ""box swap"" – heat pumps are far more sensitive to sizing and equipment selection assumptions. There are also concerns about aesthetics, rebates, operational costs, and more. For heat pump professionals, often the salesperson, these details end up as hours of ""homework"" on nights and weekends for every project (or they just don’t get done at all).We founded Amply to make the lives of heat pump professionals easier, make homeowners happier, and deliver on the potential of heat pumps to reduce emissions. If we make heat pump pro’s lives easier, they’ll have more capacity to accelerate this generational shift in infrastructure. Homeowners delighted with their heat pumps will spur more rapid adoption.

The Institute will help coastal and inland floodplain communities in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast better adapt to changes in climate and also make their human‐built infrastructure more resilient while protecting valuable ecosystems and the services they offer to human society (food, clean air and water, and energy). The Institute will combine the world‐class research capabilities ofUConnand the progressive policies and practical regulatory experience of theConnecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP)to translate sound scientific research to actions that can ensure the resilience and sustainability of both the built and natural environments of the coast and watersheds of Connecticut.While Connecticut and the Northeast are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change and associated severe weather events, the problem exists at the national and international scales, with droughts and flooding worldwide. Severe storms in the United States cause 110 deaths per year in flood-related accidents and an average of $3.8 billion annually in property damage. In addition to floods, droughts, pollution of water resources and coastal areas, ocean currents and severe weather (ice/snow/hail storms, hurricanes, etc.) are the most costly and deadly of all natural disasters. Climate change affects the water cycle increasing the frequency of abnormal weather, including heavy rains and droughts, around the world with particularly severe impacts in developing countries.

The key challenge therefore is: How can today’s climate, social, and economic justice campaigns embolden, recruit, and commit the numbers of courageous volunteers they need to win using the strategy of nonviolent mass civil resistance? How do they solve what most organizers would call ‘the mother of all organizingchallenges?’Primary Hypothesis:We know there are already free and proven individual motivators that campaigns have successfully used to increase recruitment & commitment metrics. Therefore, combining five of the best of such motivators into one mobilizing app should have a cumulative, and possibly synergistic effect. If so, this could take nonviolent civil resistance organizing the biggest leap forward since Gandhi or King, and thereby save Mother Nature and democracy itself.Our Mission:To increase the chance of nonviolent civil resistance-based campaign success to 70-80% by individually and systematically identifying and removing people’s psychological & logistical barriers to participation in such courageous campaigns -- to scale moral courage.Our Software Solution:Moves potential “on the fence” volunteers to committing to more courageous tasks and “resister-support” roles by seamlessly integrating proven and free major psychological drivers (e.g. crowdacting/conditional commitment, individualized barrier removal, motivational videos, peer- bonding) into a one-stop, mobile-friendly, free, highly secure, and open source “courage-building” ladder of engagement.
